# AirBnB Clone Project Readme

This repository contains a series of HTML and CSS files that progressively build up a web page displaying a header, footer, search filters, and search results. The goal of this project is to create a simple interface resembling the layout and functionality of an AirBnB search page. The project is structured into different stages, each adding more complexity to the page layout and design.

The project is broken down into the following stages:

0. Inline Styling
1. Head Styling
2. CSS Files
3. Zoning Done!
4. Search!
5. More Filters
6. It's (h)over
7. Display Results
8. More Details


## 0. Inline Styling

The first step is to add inline styling to the HTML files. This is done by adding the following code to the `<head>` of each HTML file:

```html
<style>
body {
  background-color: #f2
  
}
</style>
```

This will add a light gray background to the page.

## 1. Head Styling

The next step is to add some basic styling to the `<head>` of each HTML file. This is done by adding the following code to  the `<head>` of each HTML file:

```html
<style>
body {
  background-color: #f2;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Cal
